Random forest is an ensemble learning method used for predictive analytics. It combines multiple decision tree algorithms to form a forest of decision trees. Each tree in the forest makes a prediction, and the final prediction is determined by taking the average of all the trees. Random forest is used to predict the probability of an event occurring based on the data provided. It is a powerful technique for predicting outcomes based on a large amount of data. By taking the average of all the trees, it reduces variance and overfitting, resulting in more accurate predictions. Random forest is commonly used in insurance to predict the likelihood of a claim occurring, as well as the severity of the claim. It can also be used to predict the likelihood of a customer renewing their policy or to predict customer lifetime value.
Data Gathering
We need some data to start. I used the insurance tool to gather insurance co. information . Finding high-quality data sources can help reduce the strain associated with data cleaning and retrieval, which typically takes up roughly 80% of the time spent on data analysis.
Identify Anomalies/ Missing Data
If we look at the dimensions of the data, we notice only there are only 1338 rows. Looking through the data from the insurance, I noticed several missing days, which is a great reminder that data collected in the real-world will never be perfect
